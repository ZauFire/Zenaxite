			<h1>Wars Of Territories</h1>
			<h2>By ZayFire</h2>
			<div class="paragraph1">
			<p>There was a day that a colony named Crensia declared independence against a country named Zorgon and started a war against Burnsia. Burnsia is a continent with seven countries. Burnsia includes the countries Zorgon, Lunaria, Airland, Shockland, Sokia, Zarkaya, and Melodia. Crensee captured and invaded some other countries and colonies.
				I was drafted into the war and on a secret mission to find peace with the Crensians and to give back the captured territories to the correct countries. I asked the military why they picked me and they said “You are strong, brave, caring, and athletic.”

		<h2> Chapter II - Team Simulain </h2>
			<p>“I’zen, are you packed up?” My mother said “Yes, mother” I said going to the BA-M2 war boat. I said goodbye to my mother. My mother was in tears because I’m going away for almost a year. I set my things down, and started sailing. 
				The Captain was named Zach and he is my best friend, he is from Zachland. Zachland is a country far south. We were sailing across the Ustainian sea.
				 Then this girl with long brown hair jumped on our boat holding a sharp dagger saying “what are you doing.” Then she saw the Zorgish and Zakian flags and said “Wait, you guys are not the crensains.” “That's right, we are here on a secret mission.” I said “This is Zach, and I am I’zen. “Hello.” Zach said. “We are not to seek danger with you guys, we are trying to stop James Kian with is plan to lead the crensians to invade Fireland.” “In that case, I’m coming.” the girl said. “No,” I said, “you are going to end up dead.” “Well I am the top warrior in my country,” she said “ By the way, my name is Ashley, but you guys can call me Ash. “Ok Ash you can come, but on one condition,” I said “You have to tell us where you are from.” “Fine,” Ash said “I’m from eastern Ustain.”
				 She climbed into the boat and we started sailing again. “We need a name,” Zach said. “How about Simulain?” Ash said “Because we are on a similar goal here.” I “like that” I said.
